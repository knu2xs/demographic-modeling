Demographic Modeling - Installation
=========================================

Now, for the installation part. Yes, I need to write a LOT more detail than what you see
in the quickstart, but for now the quickstart and digging around to see how I did it in
the make.bat file will have to suffice. I promise to write more later, but I opted to get
*some* sort of documentation in front of you as opposed to not doing anything and suffering
paralysis through analysis - letting great get in the way of good.
