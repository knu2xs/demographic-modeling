# Notebooks

At the top level, in this directory, these notebooks demonstrate functionality, how to use aspects of the Demograhpic 
Modeling Module, and are well annotated with comments and markdown blocks discussing steps in each notebook. Inside the 
`stash` directory are notebooks with ideas where things are being experimented with, and may or (more often) may not 
actually work.

* [01-get-geographies](./01-get-geographies.ipynb) - Frequently analysis is performed using standard geographies, areas 
already delineated by an administering agencies. Being able to easily discover, select and retrieve these geographies
is briefly demonstrated in this notebook.

* [02-enrich](./02-enrich.ipynb) - Once an area of interest is delineated, either by retrieving standard geographies or
through other means, the process of enrichment enables retrieving scalar factors describing who people are living in
delineated geographic areas. This process involves discovering which variables or factors are available, selecting
the factors to use, and enriching the geographic areas.

* [03-business-search](./03-business-search.ipynb) - An essential part of modeling and forecasting in the retail 
landscape is _getting_ features in the retail landscape, notably business locations. While locations are usually
known for an organization's brand, retrieving competitive and complimentary brand locations is also essential for
modeling the retail landscape.
